# Introduction
  Network security is critical in today's interconnected world. Traditional security measures often fall short in identifying sophisticated attacks. This project leverages machine learning to analyze network traffic and identify potential threats in real-time, providing an additional layer of defense.
# Features
  Real-time intrusion detection
  Classification of different types of network attacks
  Use of various machine learning algorithms
  Easy-to-use interface for monitoring network traffic
  Detailed logging and reporting of detected intrusions  
# Datasets
The primary dataset used in this project is the NSL-KDD dataset, which is an improved version of the KDD'99 dataset. It addresses some of the inherent issues in the original dataset and provides a more reliable benchmark for intrusion detection.
